Hey all, I’m @thomas2x - Thomas Thomas. 
I'm currently enrolled in the February 20th, 2023 App Academy Boot Camp cohort. 

I got started out in tech in 2019 as a Cyber Security Engineer coop at Wayfair. I then went on to work in robotics for a little over two years as a robotics support engineer. During that time I also had the opportunity to work as a UI Research Assistant at Northeastern. I'm now happy and excited to say I am continuing my education and preparing to re-enter the work force as a software engineer! 

My current focus is on the basics of html, css, and javascript. 

Outside of work and school, I enjoy camping and running :)
